                <p>
                    When we think of virtual reality and augmented reality technologies (now referred to as XR), we
                    often drift to possibilities in gaming. While those should not be overlooked, there is real
                    potential for businesses and solution providers as well.XR helps provide context to possibility.
                    Consumers and businesses may know that they need a solution
                    but have difficulty visualizing how a product or service will enable a particular outcome.
                    Businesses can use XR to enhance their offerings and inform effective decision making.

                    Cybersecurity will no longer operate as an addendum in the world of information technology. As
                    companies leverage emerging trends and move more toward cloud computing, cybersecurity will become a
                    critical business functionality and will be an integral business process.

                    WORK-LIFE BALANCE

                <p>
                    Work-life balance is a term used for the idea that you need time for both work and other aspects of
                    life, whether those are family-related or personal interests. The saying goes that ‘all work and no
                    play makes Jack a dull boy’.

                    But work, or at least some kind of contributory effort, whether paid or voluntary, is often
                    recognised as being important for personal satisfaction, so it seems likely that ‘all play’ would be
                    dull too.
